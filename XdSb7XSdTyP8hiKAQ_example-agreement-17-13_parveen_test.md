## The first heading (one option)

This is the first clause in the agreement between the Buyer and the Seller.  Two things:
- there's only one clause option (this is the clause); and
- the defined names of the parties (Buyer and Seller) are recognised and hyperlinked automatically.

You can also add a this is the default text for the text variable. using these symbols.

## The second heading (two or more options)

This is the clause text for option 1 under heading 2 of the Agreement.  The word Agreement is highlighted because at the end of this document, it's listed as a defined word.

## Definition plurals

There is a Policy and there are also Policies.  The system can recognise the singular and plural version of a defined word.

If you'd like that function for a defined word, you just write the singular and plural the definitions section, separated by a comma.  Take a look in the definitions.

Agreement will be recognised as defined, but Agreements won't be, because the plural isn't provided in the definitions section.
